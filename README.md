# Bruce-Trail
Photos from thge Bruce Trail - 1976
Bruce Peninsula Trip Photo notes:

The Bruce Trail runs along the Niagara Escarpment.  This trip we hiked from Lion Head, Ont. to Tobermory, Ont. We took about a week. We backpacked along the trail with our teacher of the “Philosophy of Man and Nature” instructor from Troy High. He asked who wanted to go amount the students who took the class and had graduated that year. He selected a group and lead us on the trail.

These photos are not in proper order. I do not know the original order, and I do not know if the negatives survived.

Photo Notes

001	The Niagara Escarpment runs right up on the shore of Lake Huron. The escarpment (called Bruce peninsula at this point) cuts Georgian Bay off of Lake Huron.

002	It was always nice to walk in the share and dip our toes in the water to cool off. You did not want to try to wade in the icy water. When I tried I immediately lost the feeling in my legs from my knees down when I tried wading.

003	A sample of the rough terrain. That whitish mark on the rock may be a trail marker. No imagine climbing over there with a pack running from 80-100 pounds, depending on how you packed. A good pack, with hip support was essential.

004	The group at the end of the trip. You can see back then we were all in great shape! I believe that I am on the far left, but I a not positive!

005	More rough trail. Good, broken in hiking boots were absolutely essential.

006	The lake shore was always rocky. This is one of the beaches. One evening when the biting flies were not bad we formed chairs out of the rocks to relax in. On another evening they were so bad that I rushed to get my tent up and ate a cold meal and went to bed to be rid of them.

007	Another challenge was walking on top of the escarpment (the trail went up and down a couple times per day) was the rough rock. This was very hard on the ankles, and could twist one if you were not always careful.

008	Another rocky beach.

009	One of many beautiful vistas.

010	The trail could be quite a challenge when ascending or descending the escarpment.

011	A look down from on top of the “bar”. See 014.

012	Lake Huron in the evening.

013	Looking down from the escarpment.

014	The bar. A square shaped pillar, with a narrow cleft that allowed you to climb on top. This was before there was a free climbing sport. We just climbed with out fingers and toes to get on top of this rock, perhaps 25’ high. If you got up there you could share in the watered down Bourbon with out teacher.
015	Another rest stop. We would drop our packs and just goof off a little and eat. Then it was back to the trail.

016	More of the same. Sometimes we got lucky and found pools of water left by a storm that were warmed by the sun.

017	A view from the top of the cliff. You can see how shear the walls could be here. There was often a drop of couple of hundred feet.  We once saw a rabbit run across the trail into some bushes. When one of us went to see where it went, he found that there was only a foot or two left of the land, and the rest of the bushes hung over the cliff. If you were not paying attention there was nothing saving you from walking right off if it.

018	See the white dot way out in the lake? That was a trail marker. The trail guide noted that the lake had risen since the trail was marked and that “several parts of the trail today are underwater.” You were on your own to find a way around, which did cause some backtracking, hugging walls, wet feet, and carefully pressing through bushes.

019	In this shot it looks like I am just standing downhill. In fact, I was standing on a fragment of the cliff that had separated from the rest of the cliff and had not fallen yet. It was 100-150 feet high. Oh to be young and stupid again.

020	More of the trail.

021	You can see they maintained the trail, but not so far as removing the trees they cut down!

022	From the cliff top.

023	Lake Huron.

024	Hiking in the rain. Even though it made the rocks slippery, it stopped the flies (see 006) from bothering us after our worst evening of them. Unfortunately, there were “house sized boulders” that “peppered” the trail. If by peppered you mean totally covered. It was a task climbing over and around these 30-40’ boulders piled on one another with a pack on, in the rain!

025	Going down to the lake, time to cool off.

026	Another clifftop vista.

027	A good look at the height of the cliff. A gap in the cliff lets you see the height. Remember we climbed this 2 or 3 times per day, with a heavy pack.

028	Another look at the cliff height. The worst was when a valley cut into the cliff and we had a steep decent followed by a steep ascent of the cliff. Just Killer.

029	On the trail. Note the size of the backpacks.

030	Some more of the not-so-well kept trail. Expect them to keep it open, just not easy. On the other hand if you can deal with the harsh trail you can have a very pristine and quite trail.

031	On the way home. A last look.

032	Do not remember where this bridge was. It only been 42 years!

033	I do remember seeing all of the Canadian flags flying. It seemed like every house had one. It was what inspired me to always try to have a flag up at home. Can’t really do that now in an apartment.
